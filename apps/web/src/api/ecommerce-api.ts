/**
 * Hostinger Online Store client — products, categories, inventory, checkout.
 *
 * This is the ONLY supported way to talk to the store. Do not call store
 * endpoints directly and do not duplicate these exports; the store id and API
 * URL below are injected for this specific site.
 *
 * The store API is public and read-only apart from checkout, so every function
 * here is isomorphic: call them from a route `loader` (best for product pages —
 * the HTML ships with the products in it) or from the browser (best for
 * cart-driven interactions). No API key is involved, so nothing here has to be
 * kept server-side.
 *
 * Money is always in the smallest currency unit (cents). Never divide by 100
 * yourself — use `formatCurrency(cents, currencyInfo)` or the pre-formatted
 * `price_formatted` / `sale_price_formatted` on a variant, because the number of
 * decimal digits is per-currency.
 *
 * Product URLs are built from `product.url_handle`, never `product.id`: it is the
 * merchant's slug when there is one and falls back to the id only when there is
 * not, so a product page indexes as `/product/blue-mug` instead of
 * `/product/prod_01J...`. Resolve that segment back with `getProductByHandle`,
 * which accepts either form.
 *
 * The merchant also sets a title, meta description, social image and `noindex`
 * per product in the store admin. Those arrive resolved as `product.seo` —
 * hand it to `seo()` from `@/lib/seo` in the route's `meta` export, or the page
 * silently overrides what the merchant asked for.
 *
 * There is no cart endpoint: the cart is your own client state (persist it in
 * localStorage). Checkout only needs `{ variant_id, quantity }` pairs, so store
 * variant ids in the cart. `initializeCheckout` returns the checkout URL —
 * redirect to it with `window.location.href`; do not build your own payment UI.
 *
 * Appointments (products whose `type.value` is `"booking"`) are the exception to
 * "isomorphic": `getAvailability` and `getTimeSlots` resolve the visitor's time
 * zone, so they only make sense in the browser. They also never belong in the
 * cart — see their doc comments and the skill's Appointments section.
 *
 * Donations can let the customer name the amount: a variant with
 * `donation.allow_custom_amount` is priced by the buyer, not the merchant. Render
 * an amount input, validate it against `donation.min_amount`/`max_amount`, and
 * send it as `CheckoutItem.donation_amount` with `quantity: 1` — see the skill's
 * Donations section.
